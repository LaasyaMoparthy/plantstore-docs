    The Plant Store API lets you manage your plant catalog, search inventory, and receive real-time updates via webhooks.

    ### Getting Started
    - Use the **Sandbox** environment to try endpoints without authentication.
    - **Python** examples are shown by default—switch languages in the code snippet dropdown.
    - Toggle the **API Explorer** to run requests directly from the docs.
